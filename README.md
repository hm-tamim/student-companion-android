Right now, it's one of the most advanced and complete of any University in Bangladesh, probably in the world(I checked 50+ universities's apps)



Currently this app is for only North South University, but in future it will be available for all the Universities of Bangladesh.

Besides, I don't have a MacBook and Apple developer account, as a student I can't afford those things. So I couldn't able develop this app for iOS. But I have plan to do it.
