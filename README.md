On this era, mobile phone is replacing desktop for day-to day tasks. According to research, people spend  86%  time on an app than 16% on websites.

Every university should have their own app for the students instead of using 5-6 different apps for specific task. 

NSUer is a students companion and social media android app for the students of North South University. It has almost all featured needed to help student to become more productive, manages tasks easily, and stay connected with their university.

This app was developed follow by the rules of Material Design. I used MySQLi to store all the data. And PHP was used to make custom JSON APIs for the app. Security was one of the main priorities. 

<br />

Database files were not provided for privacy issues, as 6000+ students are using the app already. If needed, I can provide the empty structures.

<br />

Actually I published the app after creating few main features, to get feed backs. But I didn't expected it will get that much response, it was downloaded by 90% of the android users of my university. 

Currently it's holding 4.9 star rating(over 1300 five stars) on Google Playstore.

Right now, it's one of the most advanced and complete of any University in Bangladesh, probably in the world(I checked 50+ universities's apps)



Currently this app is for only North South University, but in future it will be available for all the Universities of Bangladesh.

Besides, I don't have a MacBook and Apple developer account, as a student I can't afford those things. So I couldn't able develop this app for iOS. But I have plan to do it.
